    "# Real-Time Change Detection on Streaming Data\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/codyrioux/pydata2015seattle/\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will be tackling the task of online change detection in data streams, which is perhaps unsurprisingly detecting \"change\" in streams of data in real-time. The objective of this tutorial is to get you from zero to being capable of detecting change and potentially implementing your own solutions. We will use the following formal definition for our problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "> If we have an ordered incoming stream of observations at discrete time intervals, then we can imagine there is some underlying generating mechanism producing the observations we are receiving in this stream. The problem of detecting change is then simply inferring from the observation stream if there has been a change to the underlying generating mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "For practical purposes in this tutorial we will use streams of doubles either generated by a synthetic data generator or a previously captured data stream at Netflix, however the objective is to explore online techniques which operate on data streams which we have not yet completely captured. To this end we will be generating synthetic data streams and processing previously captured data in a streaming fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "A great example of detecting change in an offline fashion would in the first chapter of Cam's book [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-oand-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/blob/master/Chapter1_Introduction/Chapter1.ipynb) in which he takes approximately two months of daily text message counts and attempts to determine if his texting habits changed over the course of the month. I've shamelessly lifted the image, and his data looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"texting.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis performed identifies likely distributions for texting habits before and after the change, as well as the most probable days for the change. We would likel to do this in an online fashion, and we'll be satisfied with detecting the point of change as accurately as possible. Reimagine this problem except processing the days one at a time each day and triggering an alert when we suspect the stream's generator has changed. Lets observe a handful of examples which display different change behaviors that we would like to detect: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"change1.png\">\n",
    "<img src=\"change2.png\">\n",
    "<img src=\"change3.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "So where might you find something like this useful? The answer is any metric on which it would be useful to be alerted of change might be effective. This may be a metric as simple as something that should stay relatively constant such as the temperature in a server room (a threshold may be more appropriate here but you get the idea) or something that drifts over time such as signups per hour for a small startup. At Netflix change detection is part of a larger analytics suite and is often used in conjuction with other analytics but one excellent example of where its used is the call volume for a specific device in our call centre. If the generating mechanism for this has changed it is a strong indicator that the device may be experiencing an issue streaming Netflix.\n",

    "## Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of challenges when dealing with detecting change in real-time, I'll outline a few of them here so you can think about them while we go through this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "- False Positives: Detecting change when there is none, an algorithm that is too sensitive. This is especially an issue in production when mathematical change doesn't necessarily imply change that a human cares about.\n",
    "- False Negatives: Failing to detect change when there is some change, an algorithm that is too insensitive.\n",
    "- Detection Lag: How quickly are we able to detect change?\n",
    "\n",
    "Different techniques will address these challenges differently, some will be weak in some areas and strong in others. Furthermore it depends on the characteristics of our data streams. Later when implementing your own solutions consider how they'll interact with the points above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components\n",
    "We require a handful of components to solve this problem effectively. These components include a simulator, change detector base classes, data generators and evaluation functions. Together these components can be used to construct and evaluate experiments against one another. A number of components are included in this package, though they've been kept intentionally simple for understandability. They should however also form an excellent base for a more robust system should you chose to implement any of these components directly. We'll require the following components:\n",

    "A typical concern when working on streaming algorithms is data collection. If you've ever attempted to build or acquire a large well curated data set you know that its expensive on either time or money depending on how you go about it. Streaming data is even more of a problem because unless you capture the data it is lost, and sometimes the data is streamed because its too expensive to store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible solutions to this are to observe your data stream and capture the necessary data, but you still need to manually process it and tag the data. We've got some captured data from Netflix in this tutorial, but its not enough... Another solution commonly applied to this problem is synthetic data generation. We'll create a class of data generators which create fake datasets for us with known changepoints for the purposes of testing our algorithms against a large number of data streams."

If you refer back to our challenges in the introduction this is an excellent opportunity to express preference for some, for example you might design a loss function that penalizes false positives more heavily than false negatives because you're using the algorithm to alert users and you'd rather it didn't wake anyone up in the middle of the night accidentally.\n",
